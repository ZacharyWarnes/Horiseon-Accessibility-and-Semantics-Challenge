# Horiseon Review - Semantics and Accessibility Refactor

## Pupose of This Challenge

* The purpose of the excersise is to view an "On-the-job-ticket" and complete the work requested so that the mock-up webpage matches the clients expressed wishes. 
* This excercise requires us review the html source code and add the appropriate semantics so our code is formated well. We have also been asked to add more accesibility to the page to increase Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

### How I Have Compelted This Challange

* After reviewing the code and consulting a colleague, I have replaced some of the <div> elements in the HTML source code with Semantic Elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> so that any developer that inspects the code of this page will see the content organized in a more readable format.

* I discovered one broken link in the navagation bar at the top of the page. By adding the id element to this non-working link, I restored functionality to the webpage. This allows the user to travel to a section of the page when that link is clicked.

* I added alt descriptions to all images so any user with vision impairment that has a screen reader will be able to receive a description of the image for more context to the section's content.
